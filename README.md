This City InfoBot is a user-friendly Android application designed to help citizens quickly access important local information. Built using Kivy, it features a simple login screen where users enter their Citizen ID to start chatting. Once logged in, users can ask questions about city services like garbage collection, water supply, electricity, public transport, and more. The chatbot provides instant answers based on a built-in FAQ and suggests related topics if it doesnâ€™t find an exact match. With an interactive chat interface, scrolling message history, and clear prompts, this app makes it easy for citizens to stay informed and connected to local services.
